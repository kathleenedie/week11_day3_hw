Answer the following questions:
1. What is the purpose of a breakpoint?

It let's the debugger know where to stop running the tests/programme so you can examine the results.

2. Does the line of code on a breakpoint run when you start debugging?

No, you need to step over to it.

3. How do we debug the next line of code?

Click the down button to step over and run that line.

4. What does the step into command do?

It takes you to the code contained in that line so you can examine it (i.e. in your src files not the tests necessarily)

5. What is the difference between evaluate expression and evaluate code fragment?

Evaluate expression runs the outcome from 1 line of code, with no semi-colons needed to close he expressions, evaluate fragment runs the outcome from multiple lines of code and normal java syntax is needed.
